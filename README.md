### They said I is âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ and I'm ok with that!

There is no **start** if you don't get me started

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... Right now I'm delving into JavaScript pretty heavily!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...JavaScript, Swift, front and backend web dev (FullStack), Phaser.js, Python, and a little bit about machine learning, neural networks and AI.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...Don't ask me anything right now, I don't know anything...just kidding, well I guess we will see as time goes on whether I do or not, right?!?
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I had my right index finger cut clean through the first knuckle when I was 4 years old. Doctors stitched my finger back on for me, and as you can imagine, it's just a slight bit shorter than the rest and makes it a bit of a problem reaching the good 'ole "y" key on the keyboard, but I suppose I manage ok!
- This is definitely something I need to help me get started <https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#overview>
