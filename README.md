- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... doing my school work.
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning ... software development and Python mostly.
- 💬 Ask me about ... Whatever you would like to ask me.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I had my right index finger cut clean through the first knuckle when I was 4 years old. Doctors stitched my finger back on for me, and as you can imagine, it's just a slight bit shorter than the rest and makes it a bit of a problem reaching the good 'ole "y" key on the keyboard, but I suppose I manage ok!
